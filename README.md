# Pointy Words
We would like a multiplayer (eventually local and online) game that relies on both diplomacy and military prowess. 
The game is meant to replicate the diplomatic tension from games like Conspiracy,
while having the edge-of-your-seat kind of combat present in a strategy game like Risk. 
The turn based system allows for a relaxed style of play while still maintaining rabid interest of the players, 
having them constantly think about and rethink their every choice.
